      <h5>Tourists Arrivals Charts for Singapore</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The charts provide insights into tourist arrivals to Singapore in 2023,
      <wbr>analyzed by both monthly trends and regional origins.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Tourist Arrivals by Month</strong> (Line Chart on the Left)</li>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Peak Period: </strong>Tourist arrivals peaked around July with approximately 1.4 million visitors. This could be due to summer holidays in many countries, making it a popular travel season.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Period: </strong>The lowest arrivals were recorded in January at around 0.9 million visitors, potentially due to the post-holiday season or colder months in other regions.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Trend: </strong>There’s a noticeable increase in tourist arrivals from January to July and then a decline from August to October, followed by a small recovery in November and December.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Insights: </em></strong>The trend suggests a strong seasonality effect, with more tourists visiting Singapore during mid-year and end-of-year holiday seasons.</li>
          </ul>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Tourist Arrivals by Region</strong> (Bar Chart on the Right)</li>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Top Region: </strong>Southeast Asia is the largest contributor, with over 5 million tourists arriving from this region. This makes sense as Singapore is geographically close and culturally connected to Southeast Asia.</li>
          <li><strong>Second-Highest Region: </strong>Greater China ranks second, contributing around 2 million tourists. This may include travelers from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, markets that typically have strong travel connections to Singapore.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Significant Contributors: </strong>Europe and Oceania show moderate levels of arrivals, each contributing between 500,000 to 1 million tourists.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor Contributors: </strong>Regions like Africa, West Asia, and the Americas have relatively low tourist arrival numbers, indicating fewer visitors from these regions.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Insights: </em></strong>The dominance of tourists from neighboring regions reflects Singapore’s appeal within Asia, though it continues to attract visitors from Western regions like Europe and Oceania.</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>The data suggests that tourist arrivals to Singapore in 2023 were influenced by seasonality, with a mid-year peak, and that the majority of tourists came from Southeast Asia, followed by Greater China. This aligns with Singapore’s position as a travel hub in Asia and its connectivity with nearby regions.</p>
